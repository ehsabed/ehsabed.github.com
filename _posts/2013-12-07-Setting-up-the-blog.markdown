I had started e few months ago setting up this blog on Github. But then I really not got around to finish it. After reading a few blogposts about Jekyll and Github I decided now was the time.

Since my memory is not what it used to be, I have naturally forgotten what I was doing the last time I started this. So, I better start all over...

See how other clever people have done is the best way to learn new things. One example is Phil Haack's blog, so I started with cloning his Github repo.

When looking in his repo and editing my files, I noticed a reference to Octopress. After some reading there, it looked like a nice way to setup the blog. Followinf the instructions from them, I started cloning the repo and then opened a shell and installed the dependencies.



One thing I noticed was that when I started setting up the blog, Github used username.github.com as URL, but they are now switching to username.github.io. Not sure what I will have to do, but I'll leave it as it is right now.
